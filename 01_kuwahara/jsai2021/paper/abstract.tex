\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we describe an approach to integrating
  systematic and stochastic local search based on
  Answer Set Programming (ASP).
  %
  We propose a heuristic method suitable for ASP, 
  called Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search (LNPS).
  In LNPS, an initial solution is gradually improved by destroying
  and re-searching the solution one after another.
  %
  The resulting system reads and combines a problem instance of ASP
  facts and first-order encoding for problem solving,
  which is subsequently solved by LNPS algorithm implemented using
  Python interface of ASP solver {\clingo}.
  %
  We establish the competitiveness of our approach by empirically contrasting 
  {\clingo} and more dedicated implementations, 
  through curriculum-based course timetabling.


%   solving the CCT problems
% based on Answer Set Programming (ASP; [4]). The resulting catnap
% system accepts a CCT instance in fact format and combines it with a
% first-order ASP encoding for CCT solving, which is subsequently solved
% by an o↵-the-shelf ASP system, in our case clingo. Our approach draws
% upon distinct advantages of the high-level approach of ASP, such as
% expressive language, extensible encodings, flexible multi-criteria
% optimization, etc. However, the question is whether catnap’s
% high-level approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art CCT
% solving techniques. We address this question by empirically
% contrasting catnap with dedicated implementations. From an ASP
% perspective, we gain insights into advanced modeling techniques for
% CCT. catnap’s encoding for CCT solving has the following features:
% (a) a series of compact ASP encodings, (b) easy extension for CCT
% under limiting resources, and (c) easy extension of CCT with soft
% constraints.

% In the sequel, we assume some familiarity with ASP, its semantics as
% well as its basic language constructs. Our encodings are given in the
% language of gringo series 4. Although we provide a brief introduction
% to CCT in the next section, we refer the reader to the literature [17]
% for a broader perspective.




%   Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an approach to declarative problem
% solving, combining a rich yet simple modeling language with high
% performance solving capacities.
% %
% We here develop an ASP-based approach to
% \textit{Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling} (CB-CTT),
% one of the most widely studied course timetabling problems.
% The resulting {\asap} system reads a CB-CTT instance 
% of a standard input format and converts it into a set of ASP facts.
% In turn, these facts are combined with a first-order encoding for CB-CTT solving, 
% which can subsequently be solved by any off-the-shelf ASP systems.
% %
% We establish the competitiveness of our approach by empirically
% contrasting it to the best known bounds obtained so far via
% dedicated implementations. 
% %
% Furthermore, we extend the {\asap} system to multi-objective course timetabling
% and consider \textit{minimal perturbation problems}.

%   In this publication,
% I suggest technique to apply systematic and stochastic local search 
% for combinatorial optimization problem 
% by using Answer Set Programming,
% one of the developed form of SAT. %%
% The suggestion is based on 
% Large Neighborhood Search,
% a kind of approximate solution method.
% LNS is iterative solution method,
% that cancels a part of assignment of variables 
% included in the solution at random 
% and rebuild solution 
% by reassign only the variables. %%
% In the suggestion, 
% I permit reassignment to the variable 
% that was not canceled 
% by replacing rebuilding solution 
% with re-search that maintained assignment 
% if possible. %%
% In this way, 
% I can perform the search 
% that does not depend too much 
% which assignment you cancel. %%
% I implemented suggestion technique 
% on ASP solver clingo 
% and evaluate performance 
% using benchmarks of the 
% International Timetabling Competition (all 21 problems). %%
% As a result, 
% the suggestion was able to get 
% a better solution for many problems 
% in comparison with normal ASP. %%
% In addition, 
% I succeeded in updating the known best value 
% at one problem.

%本発表では，SAT の発展形の一つである解集合プログラミング (Answer Set
%Programming; ASP) 技術を用い，組合せ最適化問題に対して系統的探索と確率
%的局所探索を統合的に適用する手法を提案する．

%提案手法は，近似解法の一種である巨大近傍探索 (Large Neighborhood
%Search; LNS) のアイデアをベースにしている．LNS は解に含まれる変数の値
%割当ての一部をランダムに選んで取り消し，その変数のみに対して再割当てを
%行うことで解を再構築する反復解法である．提案手法では，解の再構築の操作
%を，値割当てをなるべく維持したままでの再探索に置き換えることで，取り消
%されなかった変数への再割当てを許す．これによって，どの値割当てを取り消
%すかに依存しすぎない探索を行うことができる．

%提案手法を ASP ソルバー clingo 上に実装し，国際時間割競技会の問題集(全
%21問)を用いて性能評価を行った．その結果，提案手法は，通常の ASP 解法と
%比較して，多くの問題に対してより良い解を得ることができた．また，1問に
%ついて，既知の最良値を更新することに成功した．
