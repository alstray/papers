\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we describe an approach to integrating
  systematic search and stochastic local search based on
  Answer Set Programming (ASP).
  %
  We propose a heuristic method suitable for ASP, 
  called Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search (LNPS).
  In LNPS, an initial solution is gradually improved by destroying
  and re-searching the solution one after another.
  %
  The resulting system reads and combines a problem instance of ASP
  facts and first-order encoding for problem solving,
  which is subsequently solved by LNPS algorithm implemented using
  Python interface of ASP solver {\clingo}.
  %
  We establish the competitiveness of our approach by empirically contrasting 
  {\clingo} and more dedicated implementations, 
  through curriculum-based course timetabling.
